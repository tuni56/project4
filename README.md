## 1. Creating an AWS S3 bucket

Sign in with your AWS credentials.
1.2. Navigate to S3:

In the search bar at the top of the console, type "S3" and select the S3 service from the search results.

1.3. Create a Bucket:

Click on the "Create bucket" button on the S3 service dashboard.

1.4. Configure Bucket Settings:

Enter a unique bucket name for your website. Adhere to S3 naming conventions (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores).
Select a region where you want your bucket to be located (e.g., us-east-1). Important Note: This step does not require public access configuration as we'll be deploying static website content.
You can choose to copy properties from an existing bucket.

1.5. Create the Bucket:

Review your bucket settings.
Click on the "Create bucket" button at the bottom to create your S3 bucket.

## 3. Building the Simple Website
I used VS Code in order to create a simple personal website just with a css style file and a JavaScript file.
